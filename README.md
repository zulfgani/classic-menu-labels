# Classic Menu Labels
A small yet functional plugin that facilitates the ability to add a menu label to any theme's navigation menu

## How to use

### Note: The plugin assumes that your theme uses "primary" as the menu location
If not then you can change this in the Customizer by simply typing in the actual name of the menu location i.e. menu-1

Once installed and activated the plugin will enable the use of the Menu Description field for all menu items.
1. Go to Appearance and configure your menus and asign them to the appropriate theme location provided by the theme.
2. Add menu items and a one word description i.e. New, Offers, News, Sale e.t.c
3. Save and check the front end - you may need to visit the Customizer to make some more configurations

## The plugin provides minimal CSS rules
You will need add some CSS to your child theme or in the Customizer >> Additional CSS field to match your theme's output.
